Welcome to Frahidi, a comprehensive system designed to perform prosodic tasks for classical Arabic poetry. Frahidi generates high-quality datasets that can be used for fine-tuning AI models, offering robust support for Arabic poetry's complex prosodic structure. This system follows the traditional principles of Arabic prosody while leveraging modern AI technologies.

## Introduction
The Frahidi system is named after Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad Al-Farahidi, the founder of Arabic prosody. Its primary goal is to automate the tasks related to Arabic prosody, such as detecting poetic meters, identifying taf’ilat (prosodic units), and analyzing rhyme patterns. It generates a well-organized dataset designed for fine-tuning machine learning models to handle all prosodic tasks efficiently.

## System Overview
Frahidi’s architecture is divided into three main phases:
1. **Data Preparation** – Gathering, classifying, and cleansing poetry data for model training.
2. **Model Construction** – Building key components that analyze prosodic structure.
3. **Result Visualization** – Offering a clear and comprehensive view of prosodic outcomes.

## Data Preparation
In this phase, Frahidi aggregates, cleans, and verifies data from a vast corpus of Arabic poetry:
- **Data Sources**: Over 16 websites and 60 poetry blogs, including articles and books, are used to collect around 500,000 poems, amounting to over 15 million poetic verses.
- **Data Classification**: Poems are categorized based on language, meter, style, and subject matter. Frahidi employs custom algorithms for classification, filling gaps where pre-existing tags are missing.
- **Data Refinement**: After classification, a custom polishing model ensures the quality of each poetic verse for optimal processing.

## Model Construction

### Prosodic Writing
The core of Frahidi’s system is **Prosodic Writing**. This step converts written Arabic into its corresponding prosodic form:
- **Tashkeel (Diacritization)**: This crucial step assigns the correct vowel marks, handling the specific challenges of classical Arabic poetry.
- **Prosodic Rules Library**: Frahidi’s library contains a robust set of functions that apply traditional Arabic prosody rules to each poetic line.
- **Output**: The final result is a prosodically annotated verse, where only the spoken sounds are written.

### Meter and Taf’ilat Detection
Once a poem is converted into prosodic writing, Frahidi uses a custom encoding system (e.g., 0 for silent, 1 for vowelized) to identify:
- **Poetic Meters**: Frahidi detects which of the 16 classical Arabic poetic meters (bahrs) the poem follows.
- **Taf’ilat Patterns**: Prosodic units (taf’ilat) are discovered by referencing six traditional prosody texts.

### Fine-grained Prosodic Analysis
Frahidi further analyzes the poem for:
- **Modifications**: Handling exceptional cases such as metrical shifts (zihafat and ‘ilal).
- **Rhyme Rules**: It checks and analyzes rhyme patterns and resolves any structural issues.

## Visualization of Results
Frahidi includes a visual component that presents all prosodic data in an intuitive, easily interpretable interface. Users can view:
- **Meter and Taf’ilat**: Visual representation of the poem’s prosodic structure.
- **Rhyme and Rhythm**: Detailed insights into rhyme patterns and rhythmic anomalies.
